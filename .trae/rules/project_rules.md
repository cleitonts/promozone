# PromoZone Project Rules

## Project Structure

This project is divided into two main parts:
- **Backend**: GraphQL API built with NestJS
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 application with Vuetify

## Frontend Development

### GraphQL Code Generation

To generate TypeScript types and Vue composables from the GraphQL schema:

```bash
npx graphql-codegen --config codegen.yml
```

**Important**: Always use `npx` to run the GraphQL Code Generator, not `npm run codegen`. This ensures the correct version is used and avoids dependency issues.

### GraphQL File Structure

- Queries: `src/graphql/queries/`
- Mutations: `src/graphql/mutations/`
- Generated types: `src/generated/graphql.ts`

### GraphQL Authoring Policy (Frontend)

- It is strictly prohibited to write any GraphQL query or mutation outside of the `src/graphql/` directory in the frontend codebase.
- All GraphQL documents must live under `src/graphql/queries/` or `src/graphql/mutations/` and be imported where needed.
- Frontend code must only consume documents exported by `src/generated/graphql.ts` (generated by codegen) or import raw `.graphql` documents from `src/graphql/` for local `gql` usage when appropriate.

### Listing Views Policy (Frontend)

- All listing views must use `BaseGrid` for data presentation, pagination, and row actions.
- New or updated listing tasks must follow the Frontend CRUD Playbook in `.trae/rules/frontend_crud_playbook.md`.
- Avoid alternative tables or custom grids unless a documented exception is approved.

## Backend Development

### RBAC System

The project implements a complete Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with:
- Entities: Role, Permission, RolePermission, UserRole, Tenant
- Permission-based access control
- Multi-tenancy support

### Module Structure

- `authorization/`: RBAC system and access control
- `users/`: User management
- `products/`: Product management
- `posts/`: Post system
- `perfil/`: User profiles

## Code Conventions

### General Code Rules
- **ALL CODE MUST BE WRITTEN IN ENGLISH**: This includes variable names, function names, class names, documentation, commit messages, and any other code-related text. No exceptions.
- **NO CODE COMMENTS ALLOWED**: Code must be self-documenting through descriptive naming and clear structure. Comments are strictly prohibited in all source code files.
- Use descriptive and meaningful names in English that eliminate the need for comments
- Follow English naming conventions for the respective programming language
- Code should be written in a way that its purpose and functionality are immediately clear from reading the code itself

### Frontend
- Use Vue 3 Composition API
- Follow Vuetify patterns for UI components
- Use TypeScript for strong typing
- Organize components in `src/components/`
- Views in `src/views/backOffice/` for administrative area

### Backend
- Use NestJS decorators for guards and validations
- Implement permission validation in all resolvers
- Follow naming pattern: `entity.resolver.ts`, `entity.service.ts`
- Use DTOs for input validation

## Useful Commands

npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npx graphql-codegen  # Generate GraphQL types
```

### Backend
```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run test         # Run tests
