## Language Policy

### Mandatory English Usage

### Exceptions

The **ONLY** exception to this English-only policy is:

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Always** write new code in English
2. Use descriptive, self-documenting names
3. Follow established naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, etc.)
4. Write clear, concise comments in English
